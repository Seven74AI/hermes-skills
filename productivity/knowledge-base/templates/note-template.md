# Title

## Summary
3-5 sentences. The essential up top. Why this matters, what's the core argument.

## Key Claims / Points
≥4 specific claims with direct quotes (format `>`) from the source. Each claim gets:
- The claim itself (what is being asserted)
- A direct quote as evidence
- Analysis and context (why it matters, what it implies)

### 1. Claim title
> « direct quote from the source »

Analysis.

### 2. Claim title
...

## Section-by-Section / Thematic Analysis
If the content is structured (essay, article with sections, book chapters), break it down section by section. This is the DOMINANT section — longer than Key Claims + Critical Analysis combined. The reader should understand the full arc of the source.

### Section/Chapter 1: <Title>
What it argues, key evidence, notable quotes.

### Section/Chapter 2: <Title>
...

## Context
Who wrote this, why now, what's their position in the debate. Conflicts of interest, institutional biases, funding sources. 1-2 paragraphs.

## Critical Analysis
What's genuinely new vs restating? What's omitted? What's the self-interest angle? Methodological or factual issues. Keep shorter than the thematic analysis — the reader needs to understand the content before your critique.

## Nuances
What the source omits, exaggerates, or distorts. Limitations. Tone (polemical, academic, popularizer).

## Reliability
✅ verified | ⚠️ plausible | 🔬 emerging | ❌ debunked | ❓ untested

Detailed justification — why this confidence level.
