# Book Title — Author Name (YYYY)

## Summary

2-3 sentences. Central thesis of the book. Why this book exists, what it claims.

## Key Claims

≥4 claims with direct quotes (format `>`, chapter number).

### 1. Claim title

> « Direct quote from the book » (Ch. X)

Analysis and context. Why it matters, what it implies.

### 2. Claim title

> « Direct quote from the book » (Ch. X)

Analysis.

### 3. ...

### 4. ...

### 5. ...

## Chapter Summaries

Detailed chapter-by-chapter breakdown — this should be the largest section of the note. Give the reader a real sense of what the book contains, chapter by chapter. Length varies naturally: a dense chapter with multiple arguments may need 5 paragraphs, a transitional chapter may need 1. The test is coverage, not word count — would someone who hasn't read the book understand what each chapter argues?

### Introduction / Preface

What the author sets out to prove. Thesis, motivations, framing, key definitions introduced here.

### Chapter 1: <Chapter Title>

What the chapter argues, key evidence presented, notable quotes, how it fits in the book's arc.

### Chapter 2: <Chapter Title>

...

### Chapter N: Conclusion

How the author wraps up, what they want the reader to walk away with.

**Rule: Chapter summaries must be the dominant section of the note.** If Critical Analysis is longer than Chapter Summaries, the note is unbalanced and needs rework. The reader needs to understand the book's content before they care about your critique of it.

## Who Is the Author?

Background, credentials, conflicts of interest or known biases. Position in the debate. Why this book was written. 1 paragraph.

## Critical Analysis

Concise critique — shorter than Chapter Summaries + Key Claims combined. Focus on what matters: methodological flaws, factual errors, structural biases, what survives criticism.

### Methodological Issues

### Factual Issues

### What Remains Interesting / Valid

## Nuances

Limitations, blind spots, what the author omits or distorts. Tone of the book (polemical, academic, popularizer). Strengths AND weaknesses.

## Reliability

✅ verified | ⚠️ plausible | 🔬 emerging | ❌ debunked | ❓ untested

Detailed justification of the confidence level.
